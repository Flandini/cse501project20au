\title{A DSL for writing safer string manipulation functions in C}
\author{Michael Flanders}
\date{December 16, 2020}

%You can skip explaining the state of the art (i.e., how the problem is solved today).
%Instead, make sure to include a description of your language. Ideally,
%  you present a language tutorial using your previously selected examples. 
%When explaining your design, refer back to the architecture of DSL
%  implementations, similarly to how we asked you about the FFTW architecture
%  in the reading homework. 
%Please make your design description point to the relevant lines of your implementation.
%  Ideally, your doc will include links to the range of code in your github repo. 
%Please share the repo with the user rbodik. 
%Include the answers to the questions from the last slide.
%Please add the answer to the question "What knowledge or skill would have helped you
%  be more successful with the project."  The answers will help us in further upgrading
%  the course.
