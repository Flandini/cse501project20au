% Overview of project
% Overview of the sections

For this project, I built a DSL that prevents the common string and
integer related vulnerabilities and undefined behaviors in C programs.
The DSL is a small, restricted subset of C with some additional constructs
like $String$ types, iterators, range and subrange constraints, and bounded,
fold-style loops. By raising the abstraction level of strings and loops
and using the range constraints in typechecking and static analysis,
most of the common string vulnerabilities can be eliminated.

This report provides an \hyperref[sec:domain]{analysis of the problem domain (\S1)},
\hyperref[sec:language]{a description of the DSL (\S2)},
\hyperref[sec:design]{a breakdown of the design and design decisions made (\S3)},
and \hyperref[sec:discussion]{a discussion of the project (\S4)}.

\section{Domain analysis}
\label{sec:domain}

I built the DSL as a development aid for new or moderately experienced
C developers. These developers would be writing some C application
that needs to handle user input, and that user input is often a string.
The input validation, sanitization, and processing functions would be
written in the DSL, compiled to a header file, and then imported to
the project to help provide a stronger outer shell.

These security guarantees do have a cost since the performance of the
generated C code cannot compare to the performance that an experienced
C developer might be able to achieve. However, I would argue that even
using the DSL only on validation, sanitization, and pre-processing code would
provide a lot of security benefits while only having a slight performance
impact (since most of the program logic is probably not contained in these
routines).

\subsection{A motivating example}

There are many codebases that could benefit from having their input processing
code rewritten in the DSL, but here I provide only one such example where the
DSL beats static analyzers, symbolic execution, and fuzzers. I do not
provide code here since I think distributing decompiled, closed-source code
is not very legal, but the example is from a \href{https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-866/}
{vulnerability I found in Netgear routers last year.}

Figure \ref{fig:minihttpd} shows a function from the mini\_httpd
HTTP server that decodes HTML-Url encoded strings. This
same code is used in thttpd which powers sites such as
images.paypal.com, garfield.com, drudgereport.com, and
the official website of the Sovereign Principality of Sealand.

Another notable user of mini\_httpd is Netgear. Earlier
models of Netgear routers (pre-2018), use a modified version of mini\_httpd
with modifications to the decoding and sanitization functions such as
the one shown in figure \ref{fig:minihttpd}. These modifications make connecting
to the router from the Netgear phone app simpler, but also introduce a
severe vulnerability that allows networks guests to execute arbitrary code
on the router as an administrator.


\begin{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}
  static void
  strdecode( char* to, char* from )
  {
    for ( ; *from != '\0'; ++to, ++from )
    {
      if ( from[0] == '%' && isxdigit( from[1] ) && isxdigit( from[2] ) )
      {
	*to = hexit( from[1] ) * 16 + hexit( from[2] );
	from += 2;
      }
      else
      *to = *from;
    }
    *to = '\0';
  }
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Code snippet from mini\_httpd}
\label{fig:minihttpd}
\end{figure}

This is a case where the DSL would shine; static analyzers, symbolic
execution, and fuzzing would all miss the vulnerability. The vulnerability
is caused by an incorrect implementation of a check for contained substrings
and bad pointer arithmetic. However, there is no undefined behaviour or
out-of-bounds accesses, so static analyzers and tools like KLEE or CBMC
will not warn. The strings needed to trigger the vulnerability are also
very complex; the vulnerability requires providing valid URL's that the
server transforms into an exploit/payload during sanitization and validation.
By providing a very carefully crafted URL, an attacker can trick the server
into inserting a null-byte within a string buffer (this turns one string into
two and is called a poison null-byte vulnerability), performing validity checks on the
second string, and then using the first string. Complex dependencies on
network connections and the filesystem further complicate the situation for fuzzers.

Writing the validation and decoding functions in the DSL would have avoided
this vulnerability. Even though there is no guarantee on functional correctness
of programs written in the DSL, the high-level string functions remove the
need to worry about null bytes and terminators, so this vulnerability could not
even have been written. In other words, the \textit{pre-provided} string functions in the DSL
should always compile to safe and functionally correct C code which is enough
in this case.

\section{Language description}
\label{sec:language}

% Overview
% Paradigm, immutability, boundedness
% Language constructs, operators
% Ranges, subranges
% For loops

\subsection{Overview}

The language is a small subset of C with
additional constructs: range constraints on types, $String$ types instead
of char*, iterator types, and bounded, for-style for-loops. Additional changes
to the usual C semantics include making all variables immutable, assigning
default range constraints to non-constrained values, preventing recursion,
and removing  other confusing features of C such as assignments in conditional
checks, pointers, pointer arithmetic, and casting between non-numeric types.

I believe that raising string manipulation from char* operators to String
operations will remove most of the common string vulnerabilities. However,
there could still be problems when mixing integers and strings. For example,
a common way that buffer overflows occur is performing arithmetic on string
lengths and using the results to allocate new memory or bound string operations
like $strncmp$. Since many C developers default to using $int$ as their default
numeric type, signed values often make their way into the C std string functions
which operate on unsigned types. The castings that occur can result in allocating
too small buffers or copying too much data which can both cause serious vulnerabilities.

Since the generated C code will use some of these C std string functions, the DSL
needs to guarantee that no problematic integer behavior will happen. To check for
this behavior, I decided to use abstract interpretation using an interval domain.
Using the results from the analysis, I can check that, for example, when casting
from a signed type to an unsigned type, the signed value could not have been negative.
The range and subrange constraints help the abstract interpretation by reducing false
positives, simplifying some safety checks, and also add more meaning to the code.

The iterator and for-style for-loops are important because they prevent pointer
arithmetic and bound issues when iterating over arrays of strings and numbers.
As an example, the string split function returns an array of strings. If the DSL
left iterating over this array of strings to the usual C-style for-loops, the
code could still be vulnerable to out-of-bounds accesses and overflows. 

The other language features like immutability, lack of recursion, and lack of
explicit casts are just to futher simplify analyses and to make the developer's
life a bit easier.

\subsection{Syntax and semantics}

\subsubsection{Expressions}

The DSL provides the following string functions: ston (string-to-number), split,
equals, concat, append, and length. The equivalent ntos (number-to-string) is
provided for int types as well as the operators: $+$, $-$, $*$, $/$, $<$, $>$, $<=$,
$>=$, $!$, $\&\&$, and $||$. The DSL also provides the following operations on
iterator types: concat, first, and length.

I came up with these functions by rewriting string.h and writing my easy, medium,
and hard example programs using the DSL. I ended up getting rid of lots of other
string functions since they could just be built from these string functions as
syntactic sugar.

\subsubsection{Statements}

There are four statements in the DSL: for, if, return, and assignments. If, return
and assignments have their usual semantics, but the for loops are different. An example
for loop is shown in Figure \ref{fig:forloopsyntax}.

The values in the for-header
have a left hand side (LHS) and a right hand side (RHS) separated by a pipe. The LHS
must have 1 or 2 expressions of the form $varName : expr$ delimited by a comma. I
decided to allow the second iterator since I could not think of another way to compare
two strings or iterators in the DSL. If 2 iterators are specified in the LHS, then the
loop iterates until the shorter one is exhausted. The RHS requires the declaration of an
accumulator value, and this is a normal declaration except that it doesn't have to be
initialized or assigned a value. For example, in Figure \ref{fig:forloopsyntax},
\textit{int acc = 0} could also be written as \textit{int acc}, and values would get default values
of 0, empty string, or empty iterator.

The body of the for loop consists of 0 or more statements with one terminating
expression used to update the accumulator.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}
    for ( c1 : str1, c2 : str2 | int acc = 0 ) {
      ...optional statements...
      ...required terminating expression that updates acc...
    }
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Example of for-loop syntax}
\label{fig:forloopsyntax}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Functions}

Declaring a function is done in the DSL similarly to how it is done in C.
The only addition are range constraints on the return value and arguments
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:functionsyntax}. In Figure \ref{fig:functionsyntax},
the return value must be of type \textit{uint8\_t} and must be contained in
the inclusive interval $[0, 255]$. The argument \textit{numbers} is an iterator
over \textit{int32\_t} types. The iterator can hold at most 50000 numbers (inclusive),
and each \textit{int32\_t} value in the iterator must be contained in the
inclusive interval $[1, 255]$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}
    uint8_t {0, 255} averageish(int32_iter_t {1, 255} {0, 50000} numbers) {
      ...statements...
    }
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Example function declaration}
\label{fig:functionsyntax}
\end{figure}

\section{Design and decisions}
\label{sec:design}

The structure of the compiler is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pipeline}. All of it
is implemented in Scala, and the DSL code is written using a fluent-syntax,
call-chaining style. After calling $compile$ on the DSL code, the compiler
builds the AST, performs type checking and an interval analysis, and then
outputs the DSL code as a C header file if no bugs are found.

  \caption{Diagram of the compiler pipeline. (Screenshot from the marked up lecture slides)}
  \label{fig:mdnpipeline}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Interface}

The interface of the compiler is shown as the \textit{Scala DSL} box in
figure \ref{fig:pipeline}. It is the equivalent of the \textit{embedded}
and \textit{parser} blocks of the pipeline shown in figure \ref{fig:mdnpipeline}.
Originally, I was using a lexer and parser to make the syntax similar to
C as shown in figures \ref{fig:forloopsyntax} and \ref{fig:functionsyntax}, but
I switched to a fluent-syntax style in scala. The two styles are shown with
equivalent code in figures \ref{fig:csyntax} and \ref{fig:fluentsyntax}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{lstlisting}
num_iter scan_line (string clause_line)
  {
    for (lit : str_split (clause_line, " ") | num_iter literals )
    {
      ston(lit);
    }

    return literals;
  }
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Original, C-familiar syntax using a lexer and parser}
  \label{fig:csyntax}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{lstlisting}
val scanner = 
      Function("scan_line")
        .returnType(IntIterT())
        .arg(Argument("clause_line").withType(StringT))
        .startFunction()
           .loop(
             ForEach("lit")
               .inExpr(Var("clause_line").split(" "))
               .withAcc(Variable("literals").withType(IntIterT()))
               .startFor()
                 .setAcc(Var("lit").ston)
               .endFor)
           .ret(Var("literals"))
        .endFunction
    \end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Typechecking}
\subsection{Abstract interpretation}
\subsection{Code generation and safe-string library}

% Overview
% Lexer/parser vs fluent-syntax/call-chaining
% Typechecker
%  the basics and some of the other checks:
%   no recursion
%   ranges well formed (lower bound <=  upper bound)
%  monadic, pretty proud of this. Lots of Option,Either mixed, wished it was cleaner still
% Abstract interpreter
%  abstract domain is intervals
%  didn't finish, couldn't get 
%  everything is bounded, all loops end => widening and narrowing are optimizations
%   not necessities, so easier to just build abs int, act like normal interpreter and
%   just ride loops out
%  vs symbolic execution
%   ended up seeming like more work getting the integer semantics symbolic but
%   i think it would've ended up just as precise but a little slower
% Code generation
%  Didn't finish this, couldn't get:
%    most of the string functions written
%    freeing of complicated data
%     2 solutions, copy/dupe all strings from iters or some kind of analysis
%  the safe string library
%    static inlined
%    could get the code gen to just write one C function but it ended up looking messy,
%     developers might not trust it
